# TaskMaster
Desktop Revision Application written in C# w/ MSSQL

Thank you for reading me! 

If you want to download & run the project, you'll have to have some version of Visual Studio (Community will do fine) installed.

Open up the project in VS, clone the repo & open the solution. Should work fine. Or Download as a zip, unzip & load solution.

Every day you open it up it will have a list of the tasks you need to review.

Build to Release & then use that folder if you want something portable, just make sure you have the MDF files.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
enjoy
