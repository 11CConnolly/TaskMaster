# TaskMaster
Desktop Revision Application written in C# w/ MSSQL - to read the code that does stuff, look at frmMain.cs

Thank you for reading me! 

If you want to download & run the project, you'll have to have some version of Visual Studio installed (Community will do fine).

Open up the project in VS, clone the repo & open the solution. Should work fine. Or Download as a zip, unzip & load solution.

Every day you open it up it will have a list of the tasks you need to review.

Build to Release & then use that folder if you want something portable, just make sure you have the MDF files copied with it. 

This project is being updated at intervals, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
enjoy
